Problem 1
=========

For this problem we will focus on a NYC Transit data. First, let's input and clean the data.

``` r
NYC_Transit_data = 
  read.csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(
    entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)
  )
```

I have imported the data and used `select` function to select the data I need, I have also converted the entry variable from character to a logical variable with `ifelse` function. Now the variables in this dataset are line, station name, station latitude, station longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. And the dimension of this dataset is 1868, 19. These data are not tidy.

\*How many distinct stations are there?

Answer: There are 465 distinct stationsï¼ˆused inline code).

\*How many stations are ADA compliant?

Answer: There are 84 stations are ADA compliant (used inline code).

\*What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?

Answer: The proportion is 0.2129032 (used inline code).
