Problem 1
=========

For this problem we will focus on a NYC Transit data. First, let's input and clean the data.

``` r
NYC_Transit_data = 
  read.csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(
    entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)
  )
```

I have imported the data and used `select` function to select the data I need, I have also converted the entry variable from character to a logical variable with `ifelse` function. Now the variables in this dataset are line, station name, station latitude, station longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. And the dimension of this dataset is 1868, 19. These data are not tidy.
